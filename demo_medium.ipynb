      "\n",
      "**Interaction Type:** Major - increased bleeding risk\n",
      "\n",
      "**What happens:**\n",
      "Both medications affect blood clotting through different mechanisms:\n",
      "- Warfarin inhibits clotting factor production\n",
      "- Aspirin prevents platelet aggregation\n",
      "\n",
      "When combined, they substantially increase the risk of bleeding, including serious bleeding events.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Guidance:**\n",
      "- This combination is sometimes prescribed intentionally for specific conditions (like certain heart valve replacements or clot prevention)\n",
      "- Should **only be used together under close medical supervision**\n",
      "- Requires regular blood monitoring (INR tests for warfarin)\n",
      "- **Do not start aspirin** (even low-dose) while on warfarin without consulting your doctor\n",
      "- Watch for bleeding signs: unusual bruising, blood in stool/urine, prolonged bleeding from cuts, or severe headaches\n",
      "\n",
      "**Action:** If you're taking warfarin and considering aspirin, or vice versa, contact your prescribing doctor or pharmacist before combining them.\n",

      "NAIVE SYSTEM RESPONSE:\n",
      "Yes, **warfarin and ibuprofen have a significant interaction** and should be used together with caution.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The risks:**\n",
      "- **Increased bleeding risk**: Ibuprofen (an NSAID) can interfere with blood clotting and increase the blood-thinning effects of warfarin\n",
      "- May cause stomach/intestinal bleeding, which is more dangerous when on warfarin\n",
      "- Ibuprofen can also affect kidney function, potentially altering warfarin levels\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "- Avoid ibuprofen if possible while on warfarin\n",
      "- Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain relief instead - it's generally safer with warfarin\n",
      "- If you must use ibuprofen, consult your doctor first\n",
      "- Your doctor may need to monitor your INR (blood clotting levels) more frequently\n",
      "- Watch for bleeding signs: unusual bruising, bloody/dark stools, bleeding gums, or prolonged bleeding from cuts\n",

      "**The Interaction:**\n",
      "- Lisinopril (ACE inhibitor) may slightly increase the blood sugar-lowering effect of metformin\n",
      "- More importantly, both medications can affect kidney function, so their combination requires monitoring\n",
      "\n",
      "**What to Watch For:**\n",
      "- Signs of low blood sugar (though uncommon with metformin alone): shakiness, dizziness, sweating\n",
      "- Symptoms of lactic acidosis (rare): muscle pain, weakness, trouble breathing, stomach discomfort\n",
      "- Changes in kidney function\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "- This combination is commonly prescribed together and is generally safe\n",
      "- Your doctor should monitor your kidney function (creatinine levels) periodically\n",
      "- Stay well-hydrated\n",
      "- Report any unusual symptoms to your healthcare provider\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bottom line:** These medications are frequently prescribed together for patients with diabetes and high blood pressure. The benefits typically outweigh the risks, but regular monitoring is important.\n",

      "- Agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate\n",
      "- High blood pressure, dilated pupils\n",
      "- Muscle rigidity, twitching, tremors\n",
      "- Sweating, fever, nausea\n",
      "\n",
      "**Guidance:**\n",
      "- This combination is sometimes used when necessary, but requires close medical supervision\n",
      "- Your doctor may adjust doses or monitor you more frequently\n",
      "- Start with the lowest effective doses\n",
      "- **Seek immediate medical attention** if you experience symptoms of serotonin syndrome\n",

      "- Combined use can cause severe, potentially life-threatening blood pressure drops\n",
      "- This can lead to heart attack, stroke, or death\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important guidelines:**\n",
      "- Do not take sildenafil if you use any form of nitrates (nitroglycerin, isosorbide)\n",
      "- Wait at least 24 hours after sildenafil before using nitrates\n",
      "- Wait 48 hours for longer-acting versions (tadalafil/Cialis)\n",

      "Omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) reduces stomach acid, which decreases erlotinib absorption. Erlotinib needs an acidic environment to dissolve properly.\n",

      "**Clinical Impact:**\n",
      "This interaction can reduce erlotinib blood levels by 40-60%, potentially making the cancer treatment less effective.\n",

      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "- **Avoid omeprazole** and other PPIs (esomeprazole, lansoprazole, etc.) if possible\n",
      "- If acid suppression is needed, consider:\n",
      "  - **Antacids** (take 4 hours before or 2 hours after erlotinib)\n",
      "  - **H2 blockers** like famotidine (take 10 hours before or 2 hours after erlotinib)\n",

      "- This combination can lead to serious bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why this happens:**\n",
      "- Ibuprofen affects platelet function and can irritate the stomach lining\n",
      "- Both effects amplify warfarin's blood-thinning properties\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "- **Avoid ibuprofen** if you're on warfarin when possible\n",
      "- Use **acetaminophen (Tylenol)** instead for pain relief - it's generally safer with warfarin\n",

      "   - Creatine draws water into muscles\n",
      "   - **Action**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day\n",

      "\n",
      "**How it happens**: Both CBD and birth control pills are metabolized by the same liver enzymes (CYP450 system). CBD can slow down these enzymes, affecting hormone levels unpredictably.\n",

      "- **Seizure risk:** Tramadol can lower the seizure threshold, and this risk may be increased when combined with SSRIs like sertraline.\n",
      "- **Reduced pain control / more side effects:** Sertraline can inhibit **CYP2D6**, which may **reduce tramadol’s activation** (less analgesia) while still increasing side effects.\n",

      "Yes. **Omeprazole can significantly reduce the absorption and effectiveness of erlotinib.**\n",

      "- **If acid suppression is needed:** Options sometimes used include an **H2 blocker** (e.g., ranitidine/famotidine) or **antacids** with careful **dose separation**—but timing is specific and should be confirmed with your oncology/pharmacist team.\n",

      "- **What to do:** **Avoid ibuprofen** (and other NSAIDs like naproxen) unless your prescriber specifically approves it.  \n",
      "  **Preferred pain/fever option:** **Acetaminophen (paracetamol)** is generally safer, but **limit dose** and avoid prolonged/high-dose use without INR guidance (it can raise INR in some cases).\n",

This combo is sometimes prescribed intentionally (e.g., certain heart conditions), but should be **only under clinician guidance** with monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Warfarin + vitamin K:** **Interact (reduces warfarin’s effect).** Vitamin K counteracts warfarin and can **lower your INR**, increasing clot risk if intake rises suddenly. The key is **consistency**—don’t start/stop vitamin K supplements or make big diet changes (leafy greens) without discussing it. If vitamin K is given as a medication, it’s often to **reverse** warfarin.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Aspirin + vitamin K:** No major direct interaction, but vitamin K won’t “protect” you from aspirin-related bleeding.\n",

      "**What to do:**  \n",
      "If you’re on warfarin, **don’t add aspirin or vitamin K supplements** (or change vitamin K intake significantly) without checking with your prescriber/anticoagulation clinic.

      "- **What happens:** St. John’s wort **induces liver enzymes (especially CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein**, which can **increase warfarin clearance** and **lower its anticoagulant effect**.\n",
      "- **Why it matters:** Your **INR can drop**, raising the risk of **blood clots, stroke, or DVT/PE**.\n",
      "- **What to do:** **Avoid St. John’s wort** while on warfarin unless your prescriber specifically advises it. If you’ve already started or plan to stop it, contact your clinician—your **INR will likely need closer monitoring and possible dose adjustment**.\n",

      "   - *Drug Interaction Facts* (Wolters Kluwer)\n",
      "   - *Handbook of Drug Interactions* \n",
      "   - Your school's assigned pharmacology texts\n",

      "- **Patient counseling approaches**\n",
      "- **Risk stratification frameworks**\n",
